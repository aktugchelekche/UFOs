# UFOs

## Overview of Project

In this project, I will utilize JavaScript, HTML ,D3 and CSS to create an interactive and responsive website/app with BootStrap for anyone who likes to find out more about UFOs. 

### Purpose 

As we know, there are a lot of data regarding UFOs in our databases and people who likes to know more about them. By using this app, they will be able to filter the data by Date, City, State, Shape as well as Year of appearance and retrieve desired information quickly.
